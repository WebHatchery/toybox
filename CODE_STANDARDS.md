# Rust Coding Standards for Macroquad Games

**Engine**: Macroquad + macroquad-toolkit  
**Language**: Rust  
**Platform**: WebGL (WASM) + Native

This document defines the centrally maintained coding standards for Macroquad game projects. Keep project-local copies identical to the canonical `docs/CODE_STANDARDS.md`; put project-specific guidance in the project's README or another local documentation file instead.

These standards prioritize:  
- Readability over cleverness  
- Data-driven design over hardcoded values  
- Clean state management  
- Modular services for game logic  
- A clear mental model for game phases and transitions  

## 1. Core Philosophy

### 1.1 Write for Maintainability
Code should be easy to debug and extend.  
- Prefer obvious, straightforward code  
- Avoid hidden state or side effects  
- If a junior Rust developer can understand the flow, you are doing it right.

### 1.2 Consistency Beats Preference
If a pattern already exists in the codebase, follow it even if you dislike it. A consistent codebase is more valuable than a perfect one.

### 1.3 Data-Driven Design
Keep game content and configuration in JSON; see §5.3 for loading and validation rules.

### 1.4 No Unused Code
Delete unused variables, fields, and functions; never hide them with `_` prefixes. An unused parameter may use an `_` prefix only when a required trait or API signature prevents removing it.

## 2. Project Structure Rules

### 2.1 Module Responsibilities
Each module/subdirectory owns a single conceptual domain:

**Root Level:**
- `main.rs` – Entry point, game loop, phase transitions, and high-level coordination

**Subdirectories:**
- `data/` – Data structures and JSON loading
  - Type definitions for game entities
  - Constants and configuration structures

- `engine/` – Game logic services (stateless where possible)
  - Core game calculations
  - Entity management and state machines
  - Visual effects (particles, transitions)

- `state/` – Game state management
  - Current game state
  - Persistent player progression
  - Save/load functionality

- `ui/` – User interface components
  - Base UI utilities and styling
  - Reusable UI widgets
  - Uses macroquad-toolkit for buttons and interactions

- `screens/` – Screen-specific rendering (if separated from main.rs)

**Cross-Domain Rules:**
- Data types have no knowledge of engine or UI; all domains may read them.
- See §5.1 for state ownership and §7 for UI actions.

### 2.2 File Size Guideline
- Target 200–400 lines per file; begin planning a split at 600.
- Every `.rs` file has a hard limit of 800 total physical lines, including whitespace, comments, attributes, and tests. Implementation, test, generated source, example, build-script, and bench files have no exemptions.
- Extract a cohesive responsibility before a change exceeds the limit. Restructure any existing oversized file encountered during the task before completing it.
- Never meet the limit by stripping spacing, compressing formatting, or moving a single small function solely to reduce the count.
- Use the source gate described in `MACROQUAD_TOOLKIT.md`; exception lists must be empty.

### 2.3 Module Source Filenames
- Use Rust's named module source filenames: `foo.rs` for `mod foo;`, and `foo/bar.rs` for `mod bar;` inside `foo.rs`.
- Do not create new `mod.rs` files.
- When restructuring existing modules, prefer migrating `foo/mod.rs` to `foo.rs` and keeping child modules under `foo/`.
- Do not keep both `foo.rs` and `foo/mod.rs`; Rust treats that as an ambiguous module source.

### 2.4 Folder Structure

```

## 3. Naming Conventions

### 3.1 General Rules
- Types: PascalCase  
- Functions & variables: snake_case  
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE  
- Modules: snake_case  

Names should describe what the thing is, not how it works.

### 3.2 Boolean Naming
Booleans should read like facts:  
```rust
is_active  
can_interact  
has_unlocked  
should_update  
```  
Avoid `flag`, `value`, or `state` in names.

### 3.3 Service Naming
Engine services follow a naming pattern:
- `*Service` for stateless helpers
- `*Engine` for complex stateless processors
- `*StateMachine` for state progressions

## 4. Functions & Methods

### 4.1 Function Size
- Target: 20–50 lines  
- Absolute max: 100 lines  
- If a function needs scrolling, it probably needs refactoring.

### 4.2 Single Responsibility
Each function should answer one question or perform one action.

### 4.3 Argument Count
- Prefer ≤ 3 parameters  
- If more are needed, use a struct or reference to state  
- Services should take `&GameState` or `&Config` rather than many individual fields

### 4.4 Return Types
- Use `Option<T>` for potentially missing values  
- Use custom result structs for complex outcomes
- Avoid returning multiple values via tuple; create a named struct instead

## 5. Data & State Management

### 5.1 Game State Ownership
- `GameState` owns current state; `PlayerStats` owns persistent progression.
- `Game` coordinates state mutations through explicit actions and transitions; action handlers may live in dedicated modules.
- Engine services receive state and return results rather than owning mutable state.
- UI reads state and returns intents for the dispatcher to apply (§7).

### 5.2 Prefer Plain Data
Use structs with clear fields. Avoid overly clever enums with embedded logic unless they model a real state machine.  

Game data should be:  
- Serializable (Serde-friendly for save/load)  
- Easy to debug and inspect  
- Immutable after loading from JSON  

### 5.3 Data-Driven Design
- Store game constants, balance, configuration, content, and player-facing text as JSON under `assets/`; reference loaded values rather than hardcoding them.
- Load at startup through `macroquad_toolkit::include_json!` for embedded data or typed `macroquad_toolkit::data_loader` functions for runtime/native loading.
- Projects own Serde-backed schemas and semantic validation: IDs, references, balance invariants, and game rules.
- The toolkit owns generic parsing, file loading, platform branching, source-labeled diagnostics, and fallback behavior. Do not create generic project-local loader wrappers or call `serde_json::from_str` directly for game-data files.

### 5.4 Enums for Game Phases
Use enums to model distinct game states:
```rust
pub enum GamePhase {
    Loading,
    MainMenu,
    Playing,
    Paused,
    GameOver,
    // Add game-specific phases
}
```

## 6. Error Handling

### 6.1 Prefer Option Over Panics
- `panic!` is acceptable only for truly unrecoverable states  
- Missing entities or items should return `None`, not panic  
- Use:  
  - `Option<T>` for potentially missing values  
  - `Result<T, E>` for fallible I/O operations (save/load)  
  - Graceful degradation for missing data  

### 6.2 Logging Over Silent Failures
Use `eprintln!` for error conditions that should be visible during development but shouldn't crash the game.

## 7. UI Code (Macroquad-Toolkit)

### 7.1 UI Is Dumb
UI code:  
- Reads game state  
- Returns actions/intents  
- It should never contain game logic.  

### 7.2 Action Pattern
UI components return `Option<UiAction>` to signal user intent:
```rust
pub enum UiAction {
    StartGame,
    Pause,
    Resume,
    // Add game-specific actions
}
```

### 7.3 Component Organization
- `core.rs` – Color schemes, fonts, base styling  
- `components.rs` – Reusable widgets  
- Each component is a pure function: `fn draw_thing(state: &State) -> Option<UiAction>`

### 7.4 Macroquad-Toolkit Usage
Use shared toolkit widgets, input helpers, and palettes. Prefer buttons that fire on release; use press actions only when immediate feedback is intentional. See `MACROQUAD_TOOLKIT.md` for imports, API examples, and button semantics.

### 7.5 Browser Controls and Layout
- Games are touch-first: starting, tutorials, core interactions, and recovery must work through visible tap/click controls without a physical keyboard.
- Keyboard shortcuts may supplement controls. Player-facing shortcut text must also name the equivalent visible touch control.
- Tutorial prompts name the exact visible control or gesture needed next, such as “Tap CONTINUE” or “Drag the map.”
- Keep drawing separate from mutation. Support common desktop browser sizes and responsive scaling; use fixed positions only with an intentional virtual resolution.

## 8. Deployment & Web Standards

### 8.1 Required Files
Every game must have these files for deployment:
- `publish.ps1` – Build and deploy script
- `game_page.json` – Per-game metadata used to generate the WebGL host page
- `catalog_thumbnail.png` – Root-level catalog image

### 8.2 Build Targets
The game must build for:
- **Windows**: `cargo build --release`
- **Web/WASM**: `cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`

### 8.3 Validation
After meaningful game changes, run `.\publish.ps1` with no parameters from the affected project directory and report the result. If the script is missing, blocked, or fails for an unrelated environment reason, report that limitation. A local instance or dev server is not a substitute unless the user requests it.

Use project-local asset paths and make missing assets and loading failures clear during publishing.

### 8.4 WebGL Requirements
The publisher generates `dist/webgl/index.html` from
`rust_management/web/index.template.html` and the game's `game_page.json`.
Do not maintain a project-root `index.html` for a migrated game. Configure the
title, WASM name, controls, page copy, and canvas behavior in `game_page.json`;
the shared publisher derives the Project Roost slug as
`rust_<project_directory>` and the project page does not override it. Change
the shared template only for catalog-wide behavior.

### 8.5 Catalog Thumbnail
Each published game should keep `catalog_thumbnail.png` in the project root. Use a 16:9 title-screen or main-menu capture. The shared publisher deploys the file as `<game_slug>/catalog_thumbnail.png`, and the WebHatchery games catalog uses that stable path for card thumbnails.

## 9. Comments & Documentation

### 9.1 Comment Why, Not What
Code already explains what it does. Comments should explain why it exists.

### 9.2 Module-Level Docs
Each module should contain a short `//!` comment explaining its purpose:
```rust
//! Player inventory and item effects.
```

## 10. Formatting & Tooling

### 10.1 rustfmt
- Always use `cargo fmt`  
- Never fight the formatter  

### 10.2 Clippy
- Run `cargo clippy` regularly  
- Fix warnings unless intentionally ignored  
- Document any `#[allow]` with a comment

### 10.3 Variable Shadowing
- Avoid variable shadowing (hiding)
- Do not declare a new variable with the same name as an existing one in the same scope

## 11. Testing Guidelines

### 11.1 What to Test
Focus tests on:  
- Core game calculations  
- State machine transitions  
- JSON data loading  
- UI and rendering generally do not need unit tests.

### 11.2 Test Style
- Tests should read like rules  
- Avoid complex setups  
- If a test is hard to write, the code is probably too tangled.

### 11.3 Feature Test Target
- Strongly target no more than five `#[test]` cases per major feature: one cohesive responsibility, regardless of how its tests are split or named.
- Prefer high-value behavior and regression tests. Consolidate related inputs with table-driven assertions; do not bundle unrelated checks or delete useful coverage to meet the target.
- Before committing, review affected feature suites. If more than five cases are needed, briefly explain why distinct coverage warrants them.

### 11.4 Test Placement
- Each crate owns a `tests/` directory beside its `Cargo.toml`, including member crates in multi-crate repositories. Keep all tests and test-only helpers there.
- Do not add `#[cfg(test)]`, `mod tests`, test helpers, or test source files under `src/`.
- Tests exercise the crate's public API. For a binary-only game, expose testable logic through `src/lib.rs` and have `main.rs` use that library; keep internals private unless an intentional public seam is needed.
- Existing `src/**/tests.rs` files are legacy migration work. Migrate them as a separate change before expanding coverage.
- Split large suites by responsibility while preserving the feature target (§11.3) and file-size rule (§2.2).

## 12. Verification Artifacts

- Store verification screenshots directly in `docs/verification/`.
- Do not create screenshot subfolders under `docs/verification/`.
- If a new capture represents the same screen or state as an existing screenshot, replace the existing image instead of keeping duplicates.
